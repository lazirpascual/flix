# from the controller, we fetch a movie record and assign it to the @movie instance variable
# we use the form_with helper method to create a form that will submit a POST request to the /movies/:id URL
# it submits a post request because the movie record does not yet exist in the database
<h1>Create a New Movie</h1>

<%= render "form", movie: @movie %>
